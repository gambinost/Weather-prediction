# Weather-prediction
Machine Learning model to predict the weather of today and tomorrow using a complex Artificial neural network

cleaning the data and pre-processing 
visualizing the relation between the features (correlation matrix with heatmap included)
scaling and splitting the data so it can be ready for our neural network model
train it using an ANN
